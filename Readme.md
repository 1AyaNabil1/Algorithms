# Algorithms

Welcome to the **Algorithms** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to documenting and sharing my journey through algorithm learning, with a special focus on the **Grokking Algorithms** book. Here, you'll find implementations, problem-solving strategies, and solutions to challenges from various platforms.

## 📚 Learning Journey

### **Grokking Algorithms**
I am diving deep into the world of algorithms using the *Grokking Algorithms* book. Each chapter's algorithms will be documented in their respective folders with detailed explanations and implementations.

- **Binary Search**: Explore the foundational binary search algorithm. Check out the [Binary Search](./Searching%20Algorithms/Binary%20Search) folder for code implementations and insights.

## 🔍 Problem Solving

### **Platforms**
I am actively solving problems on different coding platforms and sharing my solutions here:

- **HackerRank**: Solutions to various challenges will be found in the [HackerRank Solutions](./HackerRank%20Solutions) folder.
- **LeetCode**: Check out my LeetCode problem-solving journey in the [LeetCode Solutions](./LeetCode%20Solutions) folder.
- **CodeWars**: Solutions and approaches to problems from CodeWars will be available in the [CodeWars Solutions](./CodeWars%20Solutions) folder.
